# OpenTk-Parrot
This is My Take on mono's OpenTk Parrot program.

Please use this to learn OpenAl with OpenTK.
Also rederence to where most code is from:

https://github.com/mono/opentk/blob/master/Source/Examples/OpenAL/1.1/Parrot.cs

I am not the owner nor the creator of OpenTk, Mono or any other platform I used for this example.
